# Project-Task
You can ask copilot to filter the recommendations to Microsoft 365 solutions. Then when youâ€™re given recommendations, take them one at a time , & ask for specific steps to configure in Microsoft 365
With those specific steps, you can then configure in the environment id give you access to
# Solution
To address the fraudulent email issue effectively, here's a comprehensive plan for the security analyst:
# 1. Microsoft 365 Plan Recommendation
   - Plan to Purchase: Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2. These plans include advanced email security features such as anti-phishing, anti-malware, and Safe Links/Attachments.
   - Key Features:
     - Anti-Phishing Protection: Detects and mitigates phishing attempts, including impersonation attacks.
     - Safe Links and Safe Attachments: Scans URLs and attachments in real-time to block malicious content.
     - Threat Explorer: Provides insights into email threats and trends.
     - Automated Investigation and Response (AIR): Automates threat detection and remediation.

# 2. Configuration Steps
   - Anti-Phishing Policies:
- Navigate to the Microsoft Defender portal ([security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)).
    	 - Configure anti-phishing policies to include impersonation protection and advanced thresholds.
   - Safe Links and Attachments:
     	- Enable Safe Links to rewrite and scan URLs in emails.
    	 - Configure Safe Attachments to scan and block malicious files.
   - Email Authentication:
    	 - Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols to prevent spoofing.
   - Preset Security Policies:
     	- Apply "Strict" preset security policies for maximum protection.

# 3. Testing with a Group of Users
   - Test Group:
   - Apply the new policies to a small group of test users, including non-VIP and VIP users, to evaluate effectiveness and minimize disruptions.
   - Simulation Mode:
   - Use simulation mode for sensitivity labels or DLP policies to monitor impact without enforcing restrictions.

# 4. Documentation and GitHub Repository
   - Screenshots:
     	- Use the Windows Steps Recorder or similar tools to capture configuration steps.
   - GitHub Repository:
   - Create a repository and upload screenshots with detailed explanations of each step, including the rationale and potential implications.
    	- Include a README file summarizing the policies and their expected outcomes.

# 5. Stakeholder Reports
   - Mail Flow Reports:
   - Use the Exchange Admin Center ([admin.exchange.microsoft.com](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com)) to generate mail flow reports, such as inbound/outbound messages   and non-delivery details.
   - Stakeholder Communication:
   - Share periodic reports with stakeholders to ensure transparency and build trust.
